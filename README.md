# hypothesis-testing

Hypothesis testing a statistical method to draw conclusion about the population based on a sample data.
It involves assuming two competing observations.

H0 - Null Hypothesis
H1 - Alternative Hypothesis.

Example:

Suppose a hospital created a new drug to treat patient with hypertension. they want to conduct a test wether the new drug is going to affect the patient or not.

Null Hypothesis(H0) - "The new drug will not affect the patient treatment"
Alternative Hypothesis(H1) - "The new drug will affect the patient treatment"

I have taken numpy to generate random data as patient reading before and after the treatment.
Used scipy to calculate t-test, p-value of the data.
Compared the test analysis with p-value and alpha.
finally provided the conclusion.
